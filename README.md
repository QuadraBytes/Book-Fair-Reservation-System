# Book Fair Reservation System

This is the EC8208 software architecture project repository. This repository includes all backend and frontend codebases of the project and the documentations as well.

## Overview

The **Book Fair Reservation System** allows users to explore, reserve, and manage book fair stalls efficiently.  

It provides two main interfaces:
- **Admin App** – for monitoring stalls, reservations, and users.  
- **User App** – for users to browse and reserve available stalls.
